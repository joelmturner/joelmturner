I'm a developer, mainly working in JavaScript. I'm currently living in Portland and working at [Sprinklr](https://www.sprinklr.com/).

#### What I'm Learning

I try to write about what I'm learning on [my site](https://joelmturner.com/blog), on [DEV](https://dev.to/joelmturner), and explore code samples through [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/all/data-vis).

Here are some of the topics I'm learning about:

- Data Visualization
- TypeScript
- React
- Productivity

#### Cool Projects

Lately, I have been able to contribute to the following projects.

- [WHO COVID-19 Dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/)
- [COVID HQ Africa](https://www.covidhqafrica.com/)
- [gatsby-source-instagram](https://github.com/oorestisime/gatsby-source-instagram)

#### Lettering/Sketching

I like to draw to help me relax and express some creativity.
